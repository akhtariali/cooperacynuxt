# COOPERACY CODERS

![Image](assets/image/github/image3.png)

Hi and welcome to Cooperacy Coders main document. This is an introductory document for who wants to help the development and maintenance of the platform. You can read about the platform here: [https://cooperacy.org/platform](https://cooperacy.org/platform) . The official discussion channel is: [https://discord.gg/sKb5Ju](https://discord.gg/sKb5Ju)

You do not need to know or support the platform, for you it‚Äôs just a way to learn to code.

Because it is learning and coding, please feel free to ask.

I will say it again: nobody here is your teacher, we‚Äôve got tasks for you and a lot to learn but it is not a "course", nobody will fill in the code for you, but it is expected from you to start with questions. You should learn to ask. Ask about your role, what can you help with, and when you receive a task, paste your code and ask: ‚ÄúWhat is wrong here?‚Äù. If you don't, maybe you'll feel the project is too complex, or you won't understand how it is structured, etc.

This is due to the fact some guys know html/css/js, some have vue too in their knowledge, some have a node background, some want to do backend. Better to start talking rather than expecting. So don't expect, communicate!

Moreover, it's a dynamic group. You are free and can come and go.
But.. remember to ask, communicate, interact.

**THE REPO**
We‚Äôre based on NODEJS, EXPRESS, VUE, VUEX, NUXT, BOOTSTRAP, BABEL, WEBPACK and a MySQL database. The need for MySQL instead of mongodb or other nosql is because we must address the relational structure for the platform.

If you do not understand something here, remember to ask :)

As head of the project, and because I am currently coding alone, I tend to prefer one-line coding rather than multi-line, but you can use whatever style you like. You can rewrite or reorganise the pages so that they are more standard, and help the project.

Again, communicate your doubts. And you will gradually be happy.

Thanks!

## CHALLENGE ONE: GITHUB!
If you pass this challenge you will be approaching the contributors zone, and be listed in the contributors.md file of this repo.
### GITHUB
Cooperacy is based on GitHub repositories. You find them here: [https://github.com/amdp](https://github.com/amdp)

For detailed and complete guide please see [https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) . If you do not want to follow the guide, please‚Ä¶ ask üòÑ

Git is quite complicated for newcomers so it is important for you to tell your difficulties. It is important that you learn it too though, because most of the world projects are updated thanks to the git process.

**Basically all you need to do is:**
1.  Creating github account.
    
2.  [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and clone your fork (read [https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Branch-VS-Fork/td-p/10619](https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Branch-VS-Fork/td-p/10619) )
    
3.  Create a new branch in your fork
    
4.  Work with it, edit, write new code
    
5.  Test it locally
    
6.  Request a Pull / Merge
    
7.  Await for integration!

Last but not least, have fun.

For doubts about every step, please ask! :)

**Note:**

When you create a new branch, you can mess around as much as you like, you won't destroy the software. When you want to issue a pull request, you should send only the changes that really matter, not everything you changed for testing. So the branch is your playground, but when you want your changes to be sent to the main program for integration you tidy everything up and issue your pull request.
As per your first challenge, edit the contributors.md file and insert you in the "learners" list. Make a pull request and you're done.


### CHALLENGE 2: INSTALL MYSQL
Please install Mysql 5.7 ([https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html#downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html#downloads))

On windows, [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html) (Note: MySQL Installer is 32 bit, but will install both 32 bit and 64 bit binaries.)

This step is not easy! If you find it difficult ASK!

To create a new database in MySql just follow the many guides online, you can also use "adminer" with root after having set a root password in MySQL:

[https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-set-change-and-recover-a-mysql-root-password/](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-set-change-and-recover-a-mysql-root-password/)

Once root, create a new database and set up a user granting all privileges for the database to the user you created. Remember to give the user a password. Then log out and log in again not with root, but with the user.

![Image](assets/image/github/image2.png)

Then run the long list of commands you find in the file dimbdatabase in the /etc or root folder of the repo: just copy ALL the text and then paste it using the sql commands in any database/sql editor/online tool (see https://www.adminer.org/ ) after you connected to your created database. This will give you some dumb data to test the platform. In adminer, open the right database and click on SQL command.

![Image](assets/image/github/image1.png)

PS: Remember to start your mysql server!
PS: You need php to be installed to use adminer, if you don't want to use adminer you can use any tool like heidi or mysqlworkbench.

When you have done this step, edit the contributors.md and add your email after your name!

### CHALLENGE 3: INSTALL NODE AND NPM

Install Nodejs and Npm. First of all, node is based on npm, the package manager.

`'npm i xxx'` is the command that installs xxx
then there are other commands, like `'npm update'` or `'npm uninstall'`

If you add the switch `'-g'` when you install something, it will install globally, but it is not recommended, it‚Äôs better to install everything in the directory of your repository so that when you delete it you have nothing installed in your main system. ONLY npm and few other stuff have to be installed globally.

The npm manager works with the `'package.json'` file that you have in the main folder of the repo:
```
    "@nuxtjs/auth": "^4.8.1",
...
    "bootstrap": "^4.1.3",
    "bootstrap-vue": "^2.0.0-rc.26",
...
```
all these are currently build dependencies, but you can also separate them into build (the ones you see) and for example dev-dependencies. You can see in the same file the line:
`"devDependencies": {}`

in node there is a difference between coding to test (dev) and setting up the environment for "production" or "online": build means we're going to go online and we do not need special features like autoreload. It's like when a dress has the marks with chalk or the needles, it's not definitive and you need it like that to play with it a little bit when you are measuring it or testing if it fits you. When you wear it, it's online :)

Did you install node and npm? Well, you passed Challenge 3. You are now ready to install the repo, and gain level 2!


### FINAL CHALLENGE LEVEL ONE: NUXT
VUE AND NUXT
Basically nuxt makes SSR easier, it renders the files both on server and on client side for better performance. Vue, instead, is very nice as lets you have DYNAMIC VARIABLES in your html code. For example, you can have a "for" loop into a div, and the div will automagically produce many divs as many elements in the for loop. Imagine you have a list of projects in a database, they will be cycled by the for loop and rendered, with a simple instruction in the html tag. Finally you can have COMPONENTS, that are pieces of code that you refer to with a simple tag, for example to insert the "banner" code into any of your pages, you would just enter <banner /> in your html and.. ta-daan, there it is.
For more info, please ask!

CSS
We use bootstrap + a single coo.css file. Keep in mind, though, that Vue uses VueBootrap, an ad-hoc version of Bootstrap. Nothing really complicated, but in case.. please ask! :)

INSTALLATION
To set the repo up, go to its directory (if you downloaded a zip, extract it). Then run ‚Äònpm i‚Äô, it will install all the required files.
Rename the dumbenv file you find in /etc or root folder in a file named ‚Äò.env‚Äô 
Finally, to start the repo, run: ‚Äònpm run dev‚Äò: it will run nuxt in development mode. 
If you get the error ETIMEDOUT check that HOST is 127.0.0.1 or ‚Äòlocalhost‚Äô.
There could be some issues, so please learn to ask in the discord server about how to solve them.

If you see the colorful cooperacy circle you've done it! Send a screenshot in the discord server and celebrate!
In the contributors.md move your line to the NUXTERS level!

## LEVEL TWO CHALLENGES: NUXT BASE LEARNING

///EXPERIMENTAL PART ///

**THE REPO AND THE THREE FILES**

There are three important files :

1. nuxt.config.js This is the nuxt configuration. It‚Äôs some config that allows nuxt to work properly.

2. db.js This is a very long file with all the node.js backend. It‚Äôs full of instructions for the database.

3. store/index.js store/index.js is VUEX. It‚Äôs sort of complicated, this stores variables coming from the database in a way that all the client side may access to them independently from the starting file/url.

To see the registered user pages, go to login and register, but do not hit PAYPAL, just use BANK TRANSFER.

nuxt has three layers

CLIENT => VUE // VUEX // NODE <= SERVER
when you land in a page, vue renders the page and 
executes the <SCRIPT> part at the end of the .vue file,
with some CALLS.
These calls go to the VUEX store: how do we recognise them?
they all start with $store, for example this.$store.dispatch
see for example index.vue

In that file, today (end of july), you have an async fetch function
you will learn about the fetch function later
So, store is VUEX. In this case for the fetch function you do not have
the magic word "this" so you use store without it, that is why it is passed in the function brackets
in any case store refers to the VUEX file /store/index.js

The VUEX store has a state list, that is "LIKE" global variables
"LIKE", not the same. They are variables accessible from any vue file,
which is good because sometimes you need to have common variables
amongst vue pages.

Let's see the store/index.js: these variables (states) can be changed
but ONLY BY VUEX store commands: these commands are called mutations, they come from actions.
You see in the file you have also "getters", in NUXT the getters are less used because 
of NUXT structure itself, so focus on the next kind of vuex store animals: "mutations" and "actions"
the mutations SET the store STATES
The actions instead go to the database, get the data and order the mutations to set the states
so:

STATE = list of variables that can be used THROUGH vue components and pages
MUTATIONS = internal VUEX commands that SET or CHANGE the STATE variables
ACTIONS = used to go to the server and get the data out of the DB and then mutate the STATES with the DB info

so at LOAD, NUXT sets a list of VUEX STATE variables
when a client goes on the pages the VUEX store calls go through VUEX ACTIONS to the database
then through the MUTATIONS change the STATE variables
ONLY ACTIONS go to the database
They go through the axios module.
Axios just simplifies XMLHttpRequests
but we could use XMLHttpRequests directly.
In any case, the actions use axios or xmlhttp requests to get info from the
database and mutate the vuex variables.



////////////////////////////////////
CONTINUE HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK

copied from explanations, will become part of the guide:
////////////////////////////////////



db js
let's open it
express, bodyparser, till mysql are tools node uses to handle the requests, do server stuff etc.
so the first lines are for server node functionalities
app.xx is the express variable that calls the different functions
so app.get
corresponds to GET HTTP axios requests
app.post to POST and so on
mydb is the mysql connection
mydb.execute() is to issue commands to mysql
req and res are two variables relative to the response and the request
and the SELECT blabla is the MYSQL command
the contact page should be easier to develop as it has no MYSQL call
but goes to the server to send an email
so
rain, vue works in pages and components
be aware that in nuxt some stuff DOES NOT WORK in components
like do you guys remember the async fetch function?
that DOES NOT WORK in components
so what are components and pages?
pages are pages
components are part of pages that you can reuse in any page
pretty simple
so in cooperacy we have projects
in the home page you see them
if you log in, you see YOUR projects
you guys will have the contact page, write it as you wish
the page is contact.vue
you have the old page written in php quoted
with the different fields and a google captcha
use useredit.vue as template
the first part is a good way to write the FORM


directory structure
ASSETS = css, images, etc
COMPONENTS = components
LAYOUTS = layouts :smile:
node_modules = all the node installed modules, BIG BIG folder
PAGES = pages
STATIC = try not to use this, it is not SERVER SIDE RENDERED NOR GENERALLY "NUXTED"
we will eventually leave only the favicon there :smiley:
STORE = VUEX
keep in mind for your projects that STORE works if you put an index.js file there
no file, no store

now back to useredit
we should use VUE BOOTSTRAP HTML TAGS
so extra homework could be turn the <div class="row"> into <b-row> 
SCRIPT PART
the data() function is important
syntax is data() { return { ..} }
in data() I am usually multiliner :smile:
as per the naming, I often use formVariable so that I know which is the page form variable
and which is the one I am sending to the server
as you see, you have the list of the form variables in data(){return{..
middleware: ['auth'] is for logged in members so you should remove it
methods: { ..} is for functions
you should make only one function that sends the contact form info to the server and the server sends the email to cooperacy@cooperacy.org
to send the email, you need to create a VUEX action
call it contactAction
and steal from this:
  newuserAction: async (context, payload) => {let {data} = await axios.post(process.env.DBURL+'/user', payload)
    let go = {to: payload.email, subject: 'user registration confirmation', body: 'You have been registered.'}
    axios.post(process.env.DBURL+'/email', go); return data }, 
newuserAction: async (context, payload) => {
is the standard for a vuex action in nuxt
payload is the array or object in which you insert all the form data
go back to useredit
you see this
         let res = await this.$store.dispatch('imageUploadAction', {
          formImageData: formImageData, 
          headers: {headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }},
          proptype: 'user',
        }) 
the dispatch triggers the action
and after the COMMA ,
you insert the PAYLOAD object you will find in the VUEX action
 {
          formImageData: formImageData, 
          headers: {headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }},
          proptype: 'user',
        }
this is what in the VUEX action will be "payload"
newuserAction: async (context, payload)we could make a direct axios call, but it is good to keep everything in the store so that we find all the flow to the server in the same place
imho : )
yes rain
payload is the container of the DATA that you pass to the VUEX ACTION
or mutation etc.
it is JUST A TERM
VUEX likes to call it payload
it could be BOX, CONTAINER, HEIDI
being VUEX a "store"
like a place where you store stuff
payload is like stuff
so you send the pack with the formData to the store
the pack is called payload and awaits to be sent and receive something back
the ACTION sends the payload to the server
now
final part
NODE
go to db.js
you'll find
 app.post('/email', function (req, res) {let transporter=nodemailer.createTransport({host:'smtp.gmail.com',port:465,secure:true, 
  auth:{user:'cooperacy@cooperacy.org',pass:'c00p3r4t10n'}}) /* to add html in mailOptions use " html: '<b>test</b>' " */
  let mailOptions = {from: '"Cooperacy" <cooperacy@cooperacy.org>', to:req.body.to, subject:req.body.subject, text:req.body.body}
  transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => { if (error) { return console.error(error) }
      console.log('Message %s sent: %s', info.messageId, info.response); res.render('index') })}) 

this function uses nodemailer
one of the constants we defined in the top of the file
this function SENDS a mail to the user when s/he registers
we want it to SEND a mail to cooperacy@cooperacy.org instead
so auth:{user:xx,pass:xx}}) is fine
from: '"Cooperacy" <cooperacy@cooperacy.org>', is wrong
I mean
it is ok for the function in db.js right now
not for the one you should make
the contact form is simply a mail you send to get some info
now
req.body
req.body transforms the payload you sent into variables
so if payload has payload.to payload.baby and payload.mom
you will have req.body.to req.body.baby etc
it depends how you call it in the previous steps
app.post('/email', function (req, res) {let transporter=nodemailer.createTransport({host:'smtp.gmail.com',port:465,secure:true, 
  auth:{user:'cooperacy@cooperacy.org',pass:'c00p3r4t10n'}}) /* to add html in mailOptions use " html: '<b>test</b>' " */
  let mailOptions = {from: '"Cooperacy" <cooperacy@cooperacy.org>', to:req.body.to, subject:req.body.subject, text:req.body.body}
  transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => { if (error) { return console.error(error) }
      console.log('Message %s sent: %s', info.messageId, info.response); res.render('index') })}) 
into
 app.post('/contactemail', function (req, res) {let transporter=nodemailer.createTransport({host:'smtp.gmail.com',port:465,secure:true, 
  auth:{user:'cooperacy@cooperacy.org',pass:'c00p3r4t10n'}}) /* to add html in mailOptions use " html: '<b>test</b>' " */
  let mailOptions = {from: '"Cooperacy" <cooperacy@cooperacy.org>', to:req.body.to, subject:req.body.subject, text:req.body.body}
  transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => { if (error) { return console.error(error) }
      console.log('Message %s sent: %s', info.messageId, info.response); res.render('index') })}) 
and edit app.post('/contactemail'...

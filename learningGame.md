# COOPERACY CODERS

![Image](assets/image/github/image3.png)

Hi and welcome to Cooperacy Coders main document.

This is an introductory document for those who want 
to learn Vue, Vuex, Nuxt, JS, Vue-Bootstrap, MYSQL,
Nodejs, and everything used in the project,
and then help the development and maintenance of the platform.

It is structured as a ***game***
so that you know your learning curve 
and keep track of your achievements.

You can read about the platform here:
https://cooperacy.org/platform



**The official discussion channel is:**
https://discord.gg/sKb5Ju


Note: You do not need to know or support the platform,
for you it’s just a way to learn to code.


IF YOU START THIS LEARNING GAME KEEP
IN MIND WE UPDATE IT QUITE OFTEN,
SO REMEMBER TO PULL OR GET BACK TO
THIS FILE SO YOU READ THE MOST
RECENT VERSION!


Because it is learning and coding, 
please feel free to ask.
I will say it again: nobody here is
your teacher, 
we’ve got tasks for you and a lot to
learn but it is not a "course", 
nobody will fill in the code for you,
but it is expected from you 
to start with questions. 
You should learn to ask. 
Ask about your role, 
what can you help with,
and when you receive a task, 
paste your code and ask: 
“What is wrong here?”.

If you don't understand the guide. it's
ok, it's part of the learning.

If you don't ask, maybe you'll feel 
the project is too complex, 
or you won't understand 
how it is structured, etc.
This is due to the fact some 
guys know html/css/js, 
some have vue too in their knowledge,
some have insteaf a node background, 
some want to do backend.. everyone has
a bit or a different desire and this
game makes it a challenge to merge
the participants up.

So, better to start talking 
rather than expecting.
Don't expect, communicate!

We're here: https://discord.gg/sKb5Ju


Moreover, remember it's a dynamic group. 
You are free and can come and go.
But.. remember to ask, communicate, interact.

**THE REPO**

We’re based on NODEJS, EXPRESS, VUE, 
VUEX, NUXT, VUE-BOOTSTRAP, BABEL, WEBPACK
 and a MySQL database. The need for 
MySQL instead of mongodb or other 
nosql is because we must address 
the relational structure for the 
platform.

If you do not understand something here,
remember to ask :)

As head of the project, 
and because I am currently coding alone,
 I tend to prefer one-line coding 
rather than multi-line, but you can 
use whatever style you like. 
You can rewrite or reorganise the 
pages so that they are more standard,
 and help the project this way.

Again, communicate your doubts. 
And you will gradually be happy.

Thanks!

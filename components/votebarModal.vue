      <img src="../assets/icons/freedom.svg" />
      <b>Freedom:</b>
      Freedom-voting means you would like to work for the idea or participate
      into the decision making. Every project can instead be discussed and
      observed in full transparency anyways.

      <b>Understanding:</b>
      This vote refers to the idea comprehension/smartness/nerditude and also an
      information for the project proposer. Understanding gives more visibility
      and skips the fine tuning phase.

      <b>Diversity:</b>
      When a project has a strong “bizardry” or diversity-votes, it has more
      opportunities to go randomly in the approving state.

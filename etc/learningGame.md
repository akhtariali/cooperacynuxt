# COOPERACY CODERS

![Image](assets/image/github/image3.png)

Hi and welcome to Cooperacy Coders main document.

This is an introductory document for those who want
to learn Vue, Vuex, Nuxt, JS, Vue-Bootstrap, MySQL,
Nodejs, and everything used in the project,
and then help the development and maintenance of the platform.

It is structured as a ***game***
so that you know your learning curve
and keep track of your achievements.

You can read about the platform here:
https://cooperacy.org/main/platform

**The official discussion channel is:**
https://discord.gg/sKb5Ju

Note: You do not need to know or support the platform,
for you it’s just a way to learn to code.

IF YOU START THIS LEARNING GAME KEEP
IN MIND WE UPDATE IT QUITE OFTEN,
SO REMEMBER TO PULL OR GET BACK TO
THIS FILE SO YOU READ THE MOST
RECENT VERSION!

Because it is learning and coding,
please feel free to ask.
I will say it again: nobody here is
your teacher,
we’ve got tasks for you and a lot to
learn, but it is not a “course,”
nobody will fill in the code for you,
but it is expected from you
to start with questions.
You should learn to ask.
Ask about your role,
what can you help with,
and when you receive a task,
paste your code and ask:
“What is wrong here?”.

If you don't understand the guide, it's
ok; it's part of the learning.

If you don't ask, maybe you'll feel
the project is too complicated,
or you won't understand
how it is structured, etc.
This is due to the fact some
guys know HTML/CSS/JS,
some have Vue too in their knowledge,
some have a node background instead,
some want to do backend. Everyone has
a bit of a different desire and this
game makes it a challenge to merge
the participants up.

So, better to start talking
rather than expecting.
Don't expect, communicate!

We're here: https://discord.gg/FB24r6F

Moreover, remember it's a dynamic group.
You are free and can come and go.
But remember to ask, communicate, interact.

**THE REPO**

We’re based on NodeJS, Express, Vue,
Vuex, Nuxt, Vue-Bootstrap, Babel, Webpack,
and a MySQL database. The need for
MySQL instead of MongoDB or other
NoSQL is because we must address
the relational structure for the
platform.

If you do not understand something here,
remember to ask :)

We are using Prettier and ESLint as
code formatters; you can find plugins
to make it automatically correct your
coding style so you do not need to
go crazy with style and formatting.
If you don't know how to do please...
ASK! :)

Again, communicate your doubts.
And you will gradually be happy.

Thanks!
